Safe place to drop my stable diffusion UI code

This is a UI frontend to the Stable Diffusion Web UI rest api written by https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui Automatic111.  Getting that up and running is all on you.

It provides a session-based interface to SD instead of the single-user experience of the Stable Diffusion Web UI.  Meaning, I can share it with friends.
