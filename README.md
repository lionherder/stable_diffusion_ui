Safe place to drop my stable diffusion UI code

This is a UI frontend to the Stable Diffusion Web UI rest api written by [Automatic111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).  Getting that up and running is all on you.

It provides a session-based interface to SD instead of the single-user experience of the Stable Diffusion Web UI.  Meaning, you can share it with friends.

The interface is geared for fun and sharing of images.  Anonymous.  Security through obscurity.  Database integration.
